                <p>Since October 2019 I've started playing the saxophone at my local town's harmony orchestra <a

                <p> Luck had it that the Corona lockdowns have tampered with all live shows, but that didn't mean we did
                    not play as a group. One of our projects playing at home together resulted in a nice video!

                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <p>I also have a hobby in respect of coding. </p>
                <p>I think it was around 2014 when I first started learning how to code in Excel using <b>Visual Basics
                        for Applications </b>. At work we used a lot of excel lists, and needed to manually compare and
                    evaluate data each month. I believed our computers should be able to do that for us. So with the
                    help of youtube tutorials from WiseOwl, I have taught myself during a Christmas Holiday how to build
                    tools that could do what we needed it to do, but simply clicking a button and answering a few simple
                    questions.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>And in 2021 I had some time off, giving me the opportunity to do a <b>Web Development</b> course with
                    WincAcademy. Just because I like learning new things, and who knows where this may come in handy one
                    day! </p>

                <p>As part of this course, I have created my own Javascript computergame: Guess the number. <br> Do you
                    want to play?</p>
